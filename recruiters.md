# Recruiters

When adding a company/recruiter, sort them by name and use this format:
```
### Name, Company Name,
1 Main St,
Shoreditch,
London.
EC1 1AA

* https://example.com | [careers](https://example.com/careers)
* @twitter

Seeking skills: e.g. WordPress, Laravel, etc.
```

Some Markdown formatting for naming links is fine.

A collection of companies organized alphabetically. Names that begin with a number e.g. 99 Designs, should be
organized under **Numbers**.

## Numbers

## A

## B

## C

## D

## E

### Explore Group,
9 Devonshire Square,
London.
EC2M 4YF

* https://www.explore-group.com/ | [careers](https://www.explore-group.com/jobs/28/)
