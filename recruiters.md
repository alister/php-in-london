# Recruiters

### Don't spend your time asking if contractors are looking

* talk to those candidates that want to to talk to you,
* that can fill your clients needs,
* and find out as soon as they become available.

You already know the candidates that can do the job, and that you want to be able to hire next - but what 
if you could see exactly when they were going to be available, without having to continually call them, 
*just in case* they were ready to look for a new job?

Find the contractors that want to hear from you: [Contract Availability](https://www.contractavailability.com/for/recruiters?dst=src.phpinlon).

When adding a company/recruiter, sort them by name and use this format:
```
### Name, Company Name,
1 Main St,
Shoreditch,
London.
EC1 1AA

* https://example.com | [careers](https://example.com/careers)
* @twitter

Seeking skills: e.g. WordPress, Laravel, etc.
```

Some Markdown formatting for naming links is fine.

A collection of companies organized alphabetically. Names that begin with a number e.g. 99 Designs, should be
organized under **Numbers**.
