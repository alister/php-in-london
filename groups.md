# Groups

List of **php-related** groups that are in close proximity to London.  When adding a group use this format:

``` markdown
### Group Name  
Purpose: Teach kids PHP
We meet: Monthly hackaton in <address>

* https://example.com

PHP Tech: e.g. WordPress, Laravel, etc.
```

Some Markdown formatting for naming links is fine.

A collection of groups organized alphabetically. Names that begin with a number e.g. 99 Designs, should be organized under **Numbers**. Names starting with "PHP" should use the next word for classification, e.g. "PHP London" should be under "L".
