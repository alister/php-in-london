# PHP In London, UK

There are a lot of companies in London that use PHP, and it is hard to keep 
track. If you know of any PHP companies with offices in the (Greater) London 
area (within ~20 miles), add them here with a quick pull request (you can also
edit directly from within the Github website if you want).

* [Groups](groups.md)


Not in London? I'm considering a PHP-in-UK list, let me know what you think using [the Github issue](https://github.com/alister/php-in-london/issues/27).
