There are a lot of companies in London that use PHP, and it is hard to keep 
track. If you know of any PHP companies with offices in the (Greater) London 
area (within ~20 miles), add them here with a quick pull request (you can also

### Developer? Contracting, freelance or permanent?

Tell recruiters... exactly when you are available - and tell them when you're not - [Contract Availability](https://www.contractavailability.com/).

Your time is valuable. Don't spend it chasing your next role, or fending off recruiter's calls and emails when you aren't looking.

Tell recruiters when you are next available,
Let them find you as soon as you are ready to talk to them
